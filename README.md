# This is the coursework for the Udemy course "Complete Python Developer in 2022: Zero To Mastery" by Andre Neagoie
# https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/
# The code isn't exactly as the lecturer requested. I didn't like his implementation of some concepts like checking age from date of birth (and exposing passwords). He's # a GREAT lecturer and I understand he's trying to keep it simple but I felt I had to make the changes or it would have driven me crazy. :-)
